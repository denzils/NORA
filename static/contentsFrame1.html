        <p> (1) I know what your e-mail in-box looks like, and it isn&#x2019;t pretty: a babble of come-ons and lies from hucksters and con artists. 
        (2) To find your real e-mail, you must wade through the torrent of fraud and obscenity known politely as &#x201c;unsolicited bulk e-mail&#x201d; and colloquially as &#x201c;spam.&#x201d; 
        (3) In a perverse tribute to the power of the online revolution, we are all suddenly getting the same mail: easy weight loss, get-rich-quick schemes, etc. 
        (4) The crush of these messages is now numbered in billions per day. 
        (5) &#x201c;It&#x2019;s becoming a major systems and engineering and network problem,&#x201d; says one e-mail expert. 
        (6) &#x201c;Spammers are gaining control of the Internet.&#x201d; </p>

            <p> (1) I know what your e-mail in-box looks like, and it isn&#x2019;t pretty: a babble of come-ons and lies from hucksters and con artists. 
            (2) To find your real e-mail, you must wade through the torrent of fraud and obscenity known politely as &#x201c;unsolicited bulk e-mail&#x201d; and colloquially as &#x201c;spam.&#x201d; 
            (3) In a perverse tribute to the power of the online revolution, we are all suddenly getting the same mail: easy weight loss, get-rich-quick schemes, etc.
